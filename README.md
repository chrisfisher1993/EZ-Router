# EZ-Router
We wanted to create a program that allows a user to enter destinations in which packages have to be delivered, and have the program generate a list of which order the driver should drop off said packages. This will be done through a web application. We created a user interface that allows the user to enter the destination addresses, specify any special requirements or constraints, and initiate the delivery route calculation process. We used a routing algorithm to calculate the most efficient route between the entered destinations, taking into account factors such as traffic, distance, and any other relevant constraints. Once the algorithm has generated the optimal delivery route, display it to the user in an easy-to-understand format, such as a list or a map. Additional features to the application were added, such as the ability to save and retrieve routes, track deliveries in real-time, or provide notifications to the user or driver about delivery status. Thorough testing of the application was done to ensure it works correctly and meets the user's needs.
